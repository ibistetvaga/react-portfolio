# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add Spanish translation support and a language toggle functionality to the existing React portfolio website. The system will allow users to switch between English and Spanish languages dynamically, translating all user-facing text content including section headers, descriptions, contact information, and project details while maintaining the existing design and animations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio website, I want to be able to toggle between English and Spanish languages, so that I can view the content in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display content in English by default
2. WHEN a user clicks the language toggle button THEN the system SHALL switch all text content to the selected language
3. WHEN the language is changed THEN the system SHALL persist the language preference in browser storage
4. WHEN a user returns to the site THEN the system SHALL remember their previous language selection
5. IF the user's browser language is Spanish THEN the system SHALL default to Spanish on first visit

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want all text content to be properly translated to Spanish, so that I can fully understand the portfolio information in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Spanish is selected THEN the system SHALL translate all section headers (About Me, Experience, Projects, Technologies, Get in Touch)
2. WHEN Spanish is selected THEN the system SHALL translate the hero section content including the role title and description
3. WHEN Spanish is selected THEN the system SHALL translate the about section description
4. WHEN Spanish is selected THEN the system SHALL translate all experience descriptions and role titles
5. WHEN Spanish is selected THEN the system SHALL translate all project titles and descriptions
6. WHEN Spanish is selected THEN the system SHALL translate contact section labels and content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the language toggle to be easily accessible and visually clear, so that I can quickly switch languages without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the site THEN the system SHALL display a language toggle button in the navigation area
2. WHEN the toggle is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the current language state clearly
3. WHEN hovering over the toggle THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
4. WHEN the language changes THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual confirmation of the change
5. IF the screen size is mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain toggle accessibility and usability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the translation system to be maintainable and extensible, so that additional languages can be added easily in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing translations THEN the system SHALL use a structured translation file format
2. WHEN adding new translatable content THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent key-value pattern
3. WHEN the translation system is implemented THEN the system SHALL separate translation logic from component logic
4. WHEN translations are missing THEN the system SHALL fallback to English content gracefully
5. IF new languages need to be added THEN the system SHALL support extension without major code changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the language change to be smooth and not disrupt my browsing experience, so that I can continue viewing content seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the language is changed THEN the system SHALL maintain the current scroll position
2. WHEN the language is changed THEN the system SHALL preserve any active animations or interactions
3. WHEN the language is changed THEN the system SHALL update content without page reload
4. WHEN the language is changed THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design integrity
